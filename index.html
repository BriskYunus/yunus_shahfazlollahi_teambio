      <h1>Nick Shahfazlollahi</h1>
    <p>My name is Nick Shahfazlollahi. I was born on January 8, 1997 in Kitchener, Ontario and moved to London a year after I was born. I’m a huge automotive enthusiast, I do automotive photography on the side and have always done design and video as hobbies as well. I went to Sir Frederick Banting for high school and thought pursuing business was going to be my future. When I graduated high school, I went to Western for two years taking business, ended up hating it and switched to Introduction to Media at Fanshawe. Doing that change was difficult for me but it allowed me to really figure out what my passion truly is. After that one-year program I decided to pursue Interactive Media and Design at Fanshawe’s downtown campus. I took this program because I’ve always been curious about coding, but design is my passion. I plan to be well-rounded in order to be more desirable for the companies I choose to apply to. </p>

      <h1>Brisk Yunus</h1>
    <p>My name is Brisk Yunus. I was born on February 18, 1999 in Edmonton Alberta. I lived in London, Ontario most of my life so I don’t remember living on the western part of Canada all that much. I’ve went to John Paul II Catholic Secondary School and there I’ve learnt about what passions and dreams I wanted to accomplish. I took Graphic Design and Animations in my last year there. I’ve won Principle Honour Role in those classes because I wanted to have a career in so I had great passion doing the work. I love designing so my hobbies are Photography, Image designing, Music production and even the typical drawing and painting. I mainly do portrait and landscape photography so I get invited to do some work at weddings and trips. As for music, I do soundtrack production, beats and even a little vocal work. I produced instrumental music for people that were working on games. I took Interactive Media design because I feel it really lets me express my creative work into effect and actually make things from them. Coding was always something I wanted to get into so taking this program has gotten me into HTML and CSS, so it’s something I’ve been enjoying.</p>
